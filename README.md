## Describe the OOP design of your GWack Slack Simulator

Please provide a short description of your programming progress

My programming process started wth building the GUI. I implemented a chat box for typing a message, buttons for sending, a place to see a list of all the members in the chat, and a panel of buttons and textAreas for connecting to the actual server. Once I had all of my buttons and GUI features in place, I started working on connecting to the server with the ClientHandler and the socket
